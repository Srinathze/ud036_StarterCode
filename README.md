# ud036_StarterCode
Source code for a Movie Trailer website.
Please open the html file by running the fresh_tomatoes.py.
Fresh_tomatoes opens an html file and shows the webpage with a few popular
movies with their details.


I used my own API KEY for this at http://api.themoviedb.org
For the webpage to render correctly, you have to create an API key and use it in the process.
Please use the API_KEY in the 'entertainment_center.py' file instead of using my key.
Thanks!
